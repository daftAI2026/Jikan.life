## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Design System Registry**: Implemented a comprehensive Component Registry at `/registry` with a split-pane workspace, live configuration, and instant preview.
- **Kumo Infrastructure**: Introduced `vendor/kumo` as a tracked Git submodule and established a decoupled UI component library in `src/components/ui`.
- **GEB Protocol v2**: Achieved 100% fractal documentation coverage across core directories with recursive `CLAUDE.md` maps and L3 header contracts.
- **Advanced UI Components**: 
    - **ColorPicker**: Premium implementation with WCAG contrast intelligence and state-bridging for smooth HSB/HEX sync.
    - **Button Adapter**: Intelligent wrapper mapping legacy variants to Kumo primitives with `react-aria` support.
    - **Popover**: Direct high-performance re-export of Kumo primitives.
- **Wallpaper Refinements**: Support for device-level `cols` and `padding` overrides; centralized font rendering for consistent CJK support.
- **Registry Features**: Integrated Xiaohongshu/GitHub social links and localized wallpaper testing shell.

### Changed
- **Architecture Migration**: Decoupled core registry components from vendor documentation to provide a tailored, stable design system workspace.
- **UI Primitives Migration**: Refactored 20+ base components to use Kumo-style tokens and `react-aria-components`.
- **Testing Evolution**: Expanded behavioral testing to cover design system compliance, workspace integrity, and localized rendering.
- **Global Theme Engine**: Upgraded to Tailwind v4 compatible theme tokens and native `light-dark()` schemes.

### Fixed
- **State & Logic**: Resolved HSB channel jumping, DatePicker validation matchers, lifespan input clamping, and worker cache collisions.
- **i18n & UX**: Fixed translation reactivity in `TypesSection`, corrected Goal card design, and refined iOS/Android setup instructions including terminology alignment.
- **Visuals**: Fixed color primitive clipping (overflow-hidden) and added styling refinements like DatePicker inner shadows.


### Internationalization
- **Full Card i18n**: Completed internationalization for all card stats and status labels across all supported languages.
- **Android Setup**: Synchronized instruction structure and added missing warning badges for Traditional Chinese and Japanese translations.
- **Official Terminology Alignment**: Fully aligned iOS setup instructions (Shortcuts/Automation) with Apple's official standards across English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and Japanese. Refined key terms like "Create Personal Automation", "Specific Time", and "Set Wallpaper Photo".
- **UX Layout**: Standardized iOS Step 2 into a bulleted list with nested "Time of Day" configurations across all languages.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed
- **CJK Font Rendering**: Resolved issue where Chinese and Japanese characters were not rendered in server-generated images (SVG to PNG) by explicitly specifying Noto Sans variants in the SVG font-family.

### CI/CD
- **Automation**: Added GitHub Actions workflow (`ci.yml`) for building and validating every commit, ensuring `main` branch stability.

### Documentation
- **GEB Protocol**: Achieved full compliance with the Fractal Documentation Protocol across the entire codebase (L1/L2/L3 maps aligned).

### Internationalization
- **Landing Page**: Completed i18n integration for `SetupSection` and `CustomizeSection`, enabling rich text translations via `HtmlDesc`.

### Infrastructure
- **Cloudflare**: Renamed worker service to `jikan` in `wrangler.toml`.
- **Git Maintenance**: Added `dist/` to `.gitignore` and removed existing build artifacts from version control.

### UI/UX
- **Styles**: Added specific styling for code snippets and highlight badges within i18n instructions.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-02

### Architecture
- **Vite + React Migration**: Complete rewrite of the frontend codebase from Vanilla JS to React 19 + Vite for better maintainability and performance.

- **Wallpaper Localization**: Independent language selector for wallpaper text (remaining days, progress %) with Worker-side rendering support.
- **Documentation**: Added `CLAUDE.md` (Architecture), `MULTILINGUAL.md` (i18n Guide), and bilingual `README.md`.

### Fixed
- **Visual Consistency**: Unified typography sizes/weights between Canvas preview and Server-generated SVGs.
- **Preview Rendering**: Fixed `object-fit: cover` to eliminate gaps, corrected Dark Mode visibility for Goal text, and enforced black hardware notch.

### Changed
- **Directory Structure**: Organized static assets, data, and logic following the new defined architecture.
- **Git Configuration**: Updated `.gitignore` for AI workflows and local artifacts.

### Refactored
- **State Management**: Migrated from ad-hoc DOM manipulation to React's declarative state model.
- **Rendering Pipeline**: Unified logic for Canvas (Preview) and SVG (Worker) via shared core libraries.
- **Cloudflare Deployment**: Migrated to "Static Assets" model (`/public` + `/api`) for simplified single-command deployment.
