## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-02

### Architecture
- **Vite + React Migration**: Complete rewrite of the frontend codebase from Vanilla JS to React 19 + Vite for better maintainability and performance.
- **Unified Deployment**: Adopted Cloudflare Workers Static Assets architecture. Frontend served directly from the Worker context.
- **Component-Based UI**: Refactored monolithic HTML/JS into modular React components (CustomizeSection, ColorPicker, etc.).

### Added
- **Private Task Management**: Introduced local-only `TODO.md` (git-ignored).
- **Advanced Color Picker**: Integrated `jollyui` and `react-aria-components` for a robust color selection experience including Eyedropper tool and WCAG contrast intelligence.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Full support for English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and Japanese with IP-based geolocation/language detection.
- **Wallpaper Localization**: Independent language selector for wallpaper text (remaining days, progress %) with Worker-side rendering support.
- **Documentation**: Added `CLAUDE.md` (Architecture), `MULTILINGUAL.md` (i18n Guide), and bilingual `README.md`.
- **UI Components**: Premium language selector, dynamic Google Fonts (Noto Sans), and Shadcn UI components.

### Fixed
- **Visual Consistency**: Unified typography sizes/weights between Canvas preview and Server-generated SVGs.
- **Preview Rendering**: Fixed `object-fit: cover` to eliminate gaps, corrected Dark Mode visibility for Goal text, and enforced black hardware notch.

### Changed
- **Directory Structure**: Organized static assets, data, and logic following the new defined architecture.
- **Git Configuration**: Updated `.gitignore` for AI workflows and local artifacts.

### Refactored
- **State Management**: Migrated from ad-hoc DOM manipulation to React's declarative state model.
- **Rendering Pipeline**: Unified logic for Canvas (Preview) and SVG (Worker) via shared core libraries.
- **Cloudflare Deployment**: Migrated to "Static Assets" model (`/public` + `/api`) for simplified single-command deployment.
